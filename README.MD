# Weather Viewer Application

This is a **Weather Web App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to search for a city and view its weather details using a weather API.

## Story

People always talk about the weather and frequently check it in apps.  
This web application lets you enter a city name (with autocomplete help) and see its current weather, with a UI that blends a city photo with the application.
